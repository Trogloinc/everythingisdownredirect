An OpenWRT package to issue HTTP 302 redirects to all GET requests. It uses no libraries and has no dependencies.

This is part of a minimal captive portal for the east bay mesh network. 
The idea is that the captive portal will issue redirects to mesh-hosted servers when the internet is down.
When the mesh connectivity is down as well, it will display a node-hosted web page.

If the internet is up, the captive portal will only block the exact traffic that causes modern operating systems to detect the (almost non-existant) captive portal, making the operating system show a "welcome to the mesh" page.

These features are not yet completed.

Usage:

internetisdownredirect: <ip> <port> <redirect_url> [debug]
    <ip> is the IP where internetisdownredirect binds and listens. 
      Put ALL to bind to all IPs. 
    <port> is the port where the internetisdownredirect listens (required).
    <redirect_url> is the url to which http GET and POST
     requests are redirected (required).
    If debug is specified as the third argument,
     debug output will be enabled (optional).
