An OpenWRT package to issue HTTP 303 redirects to all requests. It uses no libraries and has no dependencies.

Currently, it simply replies to all requests beginning with GET or POST with a 303 redirect to the specified URL.

In the future it will also reverse-proxy requests to the specified URL to a specified server.

Usage:

./internetisdownredirect: <port> <redirect_url> [debug]
    <port> is the port where the ./internetisdownredirect listens (required).
    <redirect_url> is the url to which http GET and POST
     requests are redirected (required).
    If debug is specified as the third argument,
     debug output will be enabled (optional).
