An OpenWRT package to issue HTTP 302 redirects to all GET requests. It uses no libraries and has no dependencies.

This is part of a minimal captive portal for the east bay mesh network. 

Usage:

everythingisdownredirect: <ip> <port> <redirect_url> [debug]
    <ip> is the IP where everythingisdownredirect binds and listens. 
      Put ALL to bind to all IPs. 
    <port> is the port where the everythingisdownredirect listens (required).
    <redirect_url> is the url to which http GET and POST
     requests are redirected (required).
    If debug is specified as the third argument,
     debug output will be enabled (optional).


The idea is that nodes detect if the internet is up by checking if the l2tp tunnel is up (the tunnel has a built-in periodic check) and check if they are connected to other mesh nodes using batctl. If neither internet nor mesh is functioning, then everythingisdownredirect is enabled.
